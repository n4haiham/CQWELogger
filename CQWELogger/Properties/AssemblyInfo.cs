[assembly: AssemblyDescription("CQ-WE Logger is used by ham radio operators to log contacts made during the CQ-WE contest.  This application was written in C# using the freely available Microsoft Visual Studio C# 2010 Express development environment.  This program installs a default Contest Settings file in \"My Documents\".  After 2011, you must download the latest contest settings file from the CQ-WE contest web site.  Log files are stored in \"XML\" format and can be read with Internet Explorer or text file editors, such as Notepad.exe.  Do not modify the log file.  To submit your contest score, email the log file (\"My Documents\\CQWELog_<year>_<callsign>.xml\") to your contest coordinator.  CQ-WE Logger interfaces with HamRadioDeluxe v4.1.  Other versions may work as well.")]
